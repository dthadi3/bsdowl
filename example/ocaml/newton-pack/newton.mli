(** Newton's method. *)

val iter : float -> (float -> float) -> float -> float
(** [iter dx f x0] is the Newton iterate obtained by applying one time
Newton's method to [f] and [x0], using the infinitesimal [dx].

It assumes the function [f] is defined for every real number. *)

val phi_iter : float -> float
(** [phi_iter x0] is the Newton iterate following [x0] and converging
the golden ratio [phi]. *)
