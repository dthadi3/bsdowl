# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR LOCAL CUSTOMISATIONS
#
# In practical projects, the `Makefile.local' file should not be
# versioned and is the ideal place to put “local” customisations such
# as the examples presented in the sequel.


# A quick, non-engineered, throw-away optical test is provided by the
# following target.  The special modificator `:tA' ensures that the
# correct path will be substituted to ${.ALLSRC} if distinct
# directories are used to hold the source and compilation objects.
#
# If your project has a real test suite, it should, of-course, be
# declared in the main `Makefile' and under version control.

do-test:		${PROGRAM}
	${.ALLSRC:tA}


# While this is a bad idea to hardwire `./configure' arguments in the
# main Makefile of the project, this can turns be out handy for the
# developer to easily reconfigure the project or to switch
# configurations.

do-configure:
	(cd ${.CURDIR} && autoconf && ./configure --prefix='/opt/bsdowl')

# Local Variables:
# mode: makefile
# End:
