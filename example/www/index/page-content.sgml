<h1 id="makeintro">Introducing Make</h1>

<p>Work on Unix systems has a strong emphasis on files, and a typical work
session with such a system involves the creation of files
<em>(sources)</em> and the invocation of many data processing
procedures <em>(recipes)</em> yielding intermediary and final files
<em>(objects)</em> as output of their work.  Most of the work is
usually performed through the use of a shell.</p>

<p>The Make program is a utility whose input is a workflow declaring
tasks (<em>targets</em> in Make's parlance) and means to achieve them,
and whose invocation yields execution of the given tasks.</p>

<p>This presentation emphasizes that Make is a day-to-day companion of
the UNIX operator, as it can be used to systematize a large part of
its work. You can read more about the Make program and
especially on the FreeBSD Make program by reading the <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/tools-make.html">paragraphs
dedicated to Make</a> in the <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/index.html">FreeBSD
Developer's Handbook</a>, and the <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/pmake/index.html">PMake
tutorial</a> (the PMake program is the venerable ancestor of FreeBSD
Make).</p>


<h1 id="makelib">Make scripts</h1>

<p>Make's input is usually not a static specification of the workflow graph,
but instead a parametrized specification of the graph, it is then
possible to generalize specifications in order to manage many similar
situations with the same specification. We call these generic
specifications <em>Make scripts,</em> it is possible to gather them in
libraries of scripts solving problems occuring in related
situations.</p>

<p>BSD Owl Scripts is a collection of such
libraries. They can be used to ease the development of OCaml
software, the production of TeX and LaTeX documents, and a couple of
other things.</p>


<h1 id="makebsd">BSD Make</h1>

<p>Make is not the name of a well defined program, but rather the
name of a large brotherhood. Each of the brother has its own strengths
and weaknesses, and also its own dialect used to prepare its input
specification. BSD OWl Scripts can be used with three of these
brothers, all of them being descendants of the make program in
BSD4.4. These programs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FreeBSD's make;</li>
  <li>MAC OS-X's bsdmake;</li>
  <li>NetBSD's bmake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users of Linux based system are likely to be equipped with GNU
Make. This version of Make is a piece of a larger puzzle, the
autotools; without these autotools, it is not so useful. However,
NetBSD's bmake works fine under many Linux based systems. You can get
source files for it at <a
href="http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/">Simon J. Gerraty's</a>, see
build instructions in the <a
href="http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/bsdowl/trunk/INSTALL?view=auto"
>INSTALL</a> file of BSD Owl Scripts distribution.</p>


<h1 id="makeisntr">Downloading, installing and using</h1>

<p>You shall download the latest source distribution: <a
href="&bps-current-tarball-url;"
>&bps-current-tarball-name;</a>. If you are running a Linux based
system, or any system but FreeBSD, NetBSD and MAC OS-X, you also shall
consider getting Simon J. Garrety's following software: <a
href="http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/bmake.tar.gz"
>bmake.tar.gz</a> and <a
href="http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/mk.tar.gz"
>mk.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/bsdowl/trunk/INSTALL?view=auto"
>INSTALL</a> file in the source distribution for installation
instructions. In a few words, you need to copy the script files in
some directory and arrange so that your Make program knows about
this.</p>

<p>Specific pages are devoted to the uses of the BSD Make Owl
Scripts:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="tex.html">producing TeX and LaTeX documents</a>,
   note that the scripts have support for the drawing tool
   METAPOST;</li>

  <li><a href="ocaml.html">producing OCaml software</a>
   covers production and installation of programs and libraries,
   although some moderately advanced features of OCaml the compilers
   are not&nbsp;(yet) supported.</li>

  <li><a href="generation.html">code generation</a> presents some code
   generation tools and their integration in BSD Owl Scripts,
   M4 and Norman Ramsey's <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/"
   >NOWEB</a> are supported;</li>

  <li><a href="guidelines.html">interface guidelines</a> presents
   aspects shared by all the scripts, documentation for specific
   scripts occasionally refers to this document;</li>

  <li><a href="writing.html">writing Makefiles</a> discusses the art
   of writing Makefiles, it assumes you already know the basics and
   focuses on techniques used in BSD Owl Scripts.</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Important Note:</em> As this is the case for most software
products, improper use of BSD Owl Scripts may lead to data
loss or other random disagreement, you are on your own! See also the <a
href="http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/bsdowl/trunk/COPYING?view=auto"
>COPYING</a> file shipped with the sources, where condition of
utilisation are stated.</p>

<h1>Software supporting BSD Owl Scripts</h1>

<p>Some software come with handy scripts using BSD Owl Scripts
Scripts, we list these friends here:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://home.gna.org/bhrid/"
  >Bhr√¨d TeX</a>, a family of TeX formats;</li>

  <li><a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/libertine"
  >Libertine</a>, a small set of libraries for the OCaml language;</li>

  <li><a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/abach"
  >Abach</a>, a would-be geometry-oriented computation library,
  for the OCaml language.</li>

</ul>


<h1>BSD Owl Scripts used to be a Gna! hosted project</h1>
