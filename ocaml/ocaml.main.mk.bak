### SYNOPSIS

# .include "ocaml.main.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# This would-be mean file has for only job to define one entry point
# slurping many other simpler files.  It is an important node in the
# hierarchy but nothing per se.
#
# This module is intended to be included by other modules rather than
# to serve as is to the end user.
