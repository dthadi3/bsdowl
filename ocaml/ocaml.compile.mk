### SYNOPSIS

#  COMPILE = byte_code|native_code|both|byte|native
# .include "ocaml.compile.mk"


### DESCRIPTION


# This module reads the COMPILE variable describing the kind of code
# that shall be produced and defines several variables that can be
# used as predicates in the sequel.
#
# A predicate is true if, and only if, the corresponding variable is
# defined.
#
# This module is intended to be included by other modules rather than
# to serve as is to the end user. (See ocaml.manual.mk for a
# module producing HTML documentation.)


# Variables:
#
#  COMPILE [byte_code]
#   List of targeted code generators
#
#   If this variable contains one of the words byte_code, byte,
#   or both, then the production of byte objects is required.
#
#   If this variable contains one of the words native_code, native
#   or both, then the production of native objects is required.
#
#
#  _OCAML_COMPILE_BYTE
#   Predicate telling if the production of byte objects is required
#
#
#  _OCAML_COMPILE_NATIVE
#   Predicate telling if the production of native objects is required
#
#
#  _OCAML_COMPILE_NATIVE_ONLY
#   Predicate telling if the production requirement narrows to native objects
#
#
#  _OCAML_COMPILE_BOTH
#   Predicate telling if the production requirement includes both types
