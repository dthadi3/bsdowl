### SYNOPSIS

# .include "ocaml.init.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# This modules is responsible for early initialisation of some
# variables used by our OCaml framework. It defines _OCAML_OBJECT and
# reads in several modules.
#
# This module is intended to be included by other modules rather than
# to serve as is to the end user.

# Variables:
#
#
#  _OCAML_OBJECT
#   The list of object groups handled by our framework
#
#
#  LIBDIR [${ocamllibdir}${PACKAGEDIR}]
#   The installation target for libraries
#
#   The value defined in `bps.own.mk` is suited for C libraries but not
#   for OCaml objects that are rather installed in the same location as
#   the standard library.
#
#
#  ocamllibdir [${libdir}]
#   Directory for ocaml libraries
#
#   See "USES+=site-lib" below.
#
#
# Uses:
#
#  site-lib: No argument allowed
#   Use ${libdir}/ocaml/site-lib as default value for ocamllibdir


### IMPLEMENTATION

.if !defined(THISMODULE)
.error ocaml.init.mk cannot be included directly.
.endif

.if !target(__<ocaml.init.mk>__)
__<ocaml.init.mk>__:

LIBDIR?=		${ocamllibdir}${PACKAGEDIR}

.include "bps.init.mk"

.if!empty(_USES_OPTIONS:Msite-lib)
ocamllibdir?=		${libdir}/ocaml/site-lib
.else
ocamllibdir?=		${libdir}
.endif
