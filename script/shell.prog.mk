### DESCRIPTION

# Variables:
#
#
#  PROGRAM [not set]
#   Name of the program
#
#   This can actually be a list of programs.  Standard directory
#   variables between `@'s are expanded in the code.
#
#   If PACKAGE is not defined, it will be guessed from PROGRAM if this
#   is a single word or from the last component of SRCDIR otherwise.
#
#
#  SUBR
#   List of script subroutine libraries to install
#
#
#  SUBRDIR [${datadir}${PACKAGEDIR}]
#   List of script libraries to install
#
#   The variables SUBRDIR, SUBRMODE, SUBROWN and
#   SUBRGRP parametrise the installation.
#
#   The SUBRDIR variable defaults to
#   `${datadir}${PACKAGEDIR}` but other sensible locations could
#   follow another pattern, like for instance
#   `${libdir}/perl5/5.12.4${PACKAGEDIR}`.
#
#
#  BINOWN, BINGRP, BINMODE, BINDIR, BINNAME
#   Parameters of the program installation
#
#   See `bps.files.mk` for a closer description of these variables.
