# Introducing Make

Work on Unix systems has a strong emphasis on files, and a typical work
session with such a system involves the creation of files
_(sources)_ and the invocation of many data processing
procedures _(recipes)_ yielding intermediary and final files
_(objects)_ as output of their work.  Most of the work is
usually performed through the use of a shell.

The Make program is a utility whose input is a workflow declaring
tasks (_targets_ in Make's parlance) and means to achieve them,
and whose invocation yields execution of the given tasks.

This presentation emphasizes that Make is a day-to-day companion of
the UNIX operator, as it can be used to systematize a large part of
its work. You can read more about the Make program and
especially on the FreeBSD Make program by reading the
[paragraphs dedicated to Make](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/tools-make.html)
in the
[FreeBSD Developer's Handbook](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/index.html),
and the
[PMake tutorial](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/pmake/index.html)
(the PMake program is the venerable ancestor of FreeBSD Make).


# Make scripts

Make's input is usually not a static specification of the workflow graph,
but instead a parametrized specification of the graph, it is then
possible to generalize specifications in order to manage many similar
situations with the same specification. We call these generic
specifications _Make scripts,_ it is possible to gather them in
libraries of scripts solving problems occuring in related
situations.

BSD Owl Scripts is a collection of such
libraries. They can be used to ease the development of OCaml
software, the production of TeX and LaTeX documents, and a couple of
other things.


# BSD Make

Make is not the name of a well defined program, but rather the
name of a large brotherhood. Each of the brother has its own strengths
and weaknesses, and also its own dialect used to prepare its input
specification. BSD Make Pall√†s scripts can be used with three of these
brothers, all of them being descendants of the make program in
BSD4.4. These programs are:

- FreeBSD's make;
- MAC OS-X's bsdmake;
- NetBSD's bmake.

Users of Linux based system are likely to be equipped with GNU
Make. This version of Make is a piece of a larger puzzle, the
autotools; without these autotools, it is not so useful. However,
NetBSD's bmake works fine under many Linux based systems. You can get
source files for it at
[Simon J. Gerraty's](http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/).
