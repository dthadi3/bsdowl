# Download BSD Owl Scripts

You can get a distribution tarball suitable for installation from the
[release area](https://github.com/michipili/bsdowl/releases).

If you are interested in modifying the software, you can clone the GIT
repository:

```
https://github.com/michipili/bsdowl.git
```

If you are running a UNIX like system for which BSD Make *is not
available* as a package, you should consider [building it from source](BMake).
For this, you should download
[bmake.tar.gz](http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/bmake.tar.gz)
and
[mk.tar.gz](http://void.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/mk.tar.gz)
distributd by Simon J. Garrety.

FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and most Linux Distributions already provides
BSD Make, wether as part of the base system or as a third party
package.

It seems that BSD Make is also packaged for Cygwin, but some users
experienced troubles with that package.
