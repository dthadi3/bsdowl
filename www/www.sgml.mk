### SYNOPSIS

# Attention: This is not a DOCBOOK system!

# WWW=   index.html
#
# SRCS=  index.sgml
# SRCS+= head-css.sgml
# SRCS+= head-title.sgml
# SRCS+= body-content.sgml
# SRCS+= body-nav.sgml
#
# WWWDIR= ${WWWROOTDIR}/subdir
#
# .include "www.sgml.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# Variables:
#
#
#  WWW [not set]
#   The list of HTML files to produce from SGML sources
#
#    Each member has its own SRCS property and the global SRCS
#    property is appended to it.
#
#
#  WWWMAIN [auto]
#   File used as entry-point for the generation
#
#    When producing several files enumerated in WWW, WWWMAIN should
#    have a property for each file.
#
#    If a file enumerated in WWW has no corresponding property in
#    WWWMAIN and a SGML file can be deduced from his name, this file
#    is used.
#
#
#  WWWROOTDIR
#   Root directory for the WWW hierarchy
#
#    This file is used to automatically define WWWDIR.
#
#
#  WWWOWN, WWWGRP, WWWMODE, WWWDIR
#   Parameters of the file installation procedure
#
#
#  SGML_INCLUDE
#   Enumerate parametrised entities to include
#
#
#  DIRS
#   Enumerate path where file are looked up
#
#   The .CURDIR and .OBJDIR are automatically added to the lookup path
#   and need not to be enumerated by DIRS.
#
#
#  CATALOG
#   Enumerate SGML catalogs
