Based on BSD Make.","body":"# BSD Owl Scripts\r\n\r\nThis collection of BSD Make directives aims at providing a highly\r\nportable build system targetting modern UNIX systems and supporting\r\ncommon or less command languages.  This is a build system, which means\r\nthat it can be used to organise fairly complex projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Applicative level features\r\n\r\nBSD Owl Scripts assists developers in the production, installation and\r\ndistribution of projects comprising the following types of products:\r\n\r\n - C programs, compiled for several targets\r\n - C libraries, static and shared, compiled for several targets\r\n - Shell scripts\r\n - Python scripts\r\n - OCaml programs\r\n - OCaml libraries, with **ocamldoc** documentation\r\n - OCaml plugins\r\n - TeX documents, prepared for several printing devices\r\n - METAPOST figures, with output as PDF, PS, SVG or PNG,\r\n   either as part of a TeX document or as standalone documents\r\n\r\nEach item is linked to a project example found in our extensive\r\ntestsuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build-system level features\r\n\r\nBSD Owl Scripts offers developers a rich set of features easing\r\nproject management:\r\n\r\n - Support of compilation profiles\r\n - Support of the parallel mode (at the directory level)\r\n - Support of separate trees for sources and objects\r\n - Support of architecture-dependant compilation options\r\n - Support **GNU autoconf**\r\n - Production of GPG-signed tarballs\r\n - Developer subshell, empowered with project-specific scripts\r\n - Literate programming using **noweb**\r\n - Preprocessing with **m4**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility list\r\n\r\nIt is well tested under:\r\n - Mac OS X, version 10.6.8 and above;\r\n - FreeBSD, version 9.0 and above;\r\n - Debian Jessie and newer.\r\n\r\nWe also want to support NetBSD and OpenBSD, as soon as they will\r\nprovide a modern version of BSD Make.\r\n\r\nThis means that projects managed with BSD Owl Scripts are easy to\r\ndevelop and deploy in heterogeneous environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Starting points\r\n\r\n - [Installation notes][start-install]\r\n - [Getting started with a LaTeX document][start-latex]\r\n - [Getting started with an OCaml program][start-ocaml]\r\n\r\nIf you are not at all familiar with makefiles you can quickly learn\r\nthe basics with de Boor's [classical tutorial][start-deboor].\r\nIt is also nice to feel confident while interacting with the shell, if\r\nthis is not the case [UNIX Power Tools][start-upt] could help you.

In 2006 it was reorganised, history was lost and it\r\nmoved to a private Subversion server.  In 2008 it was published for\r\nthe first time on GNA (gna.org).  One year later the history was\r\nconverted to git and subversion was only marginally used.  In 2013,\r\npublication on the GNA server was abandoned and the project was\r\npublished on GitHub and BitBucket, then on GitHub only.\r\n\r\nPallàs Athéné is a Greek goddess of wisdom, mother of sciences and\r\narts.
