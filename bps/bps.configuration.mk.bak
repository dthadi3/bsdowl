### DESCRIPTION

# Manage package build configurations.

# Variables:
#
#  CONFIGURATION [not set]
#    The name of a configuration build file to be read.
#
#    If CONFIGURATION is set, we try to read the file
#    ${CONFIGURATION}.mk and issue an error if this cannot be done.
#    If a file ${CONFIGURATION}_${ARCHITECTURE}.mk also exits, it is
#    also processed.
#
#    The files are to be read from the PACKAGELIBRARYCONFIGURATION
#    directory.
#
#
#  CONFIGURATIONDIR [/${CONFIGURATION} but only if CONFIGURATION is set]
#    A path element used to build a directory name dependant of configuration.
#
#
#  PACKAGELIBRARYCONFIGURATION [${SRCDIR}/Library/Configuration]
#    A directory where configuration files are stored.
#
#
#  ARCHITECTURE [not set]
#    A string identifying the architecture for which the project is built.
#
#    If set, we try to read the file
#    ${CONFIGURATION}_${ARCHITECTURE}.mk, which happens after
#    processing the file ${CONFIGURATION}.mk.
#
#    It is not and error if the file does not exist.
