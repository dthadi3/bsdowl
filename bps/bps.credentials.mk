# USE_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS = yes


### DESCRIPTION

# Implement a credential switch which applies to the targets
# enumerated in the _SWITCH_CREDENTIALS_TARGETS variable, e.g. install.

# Variables:
#
#  USE_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS
#   Command the use of the switch credential functionality
#
#   Possible values are 'yes' or 'no', it defaults to 'yes'.
#
#
#  _SWITCH_CREDENTIALS_TARGETS
#   List of targets needing a credential switch
#
#   It defaults to the empty list, except for the user is inable to
#   write in ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX}, in which case the install target is
#   added to this list.

# Add the `install` target if the current user is not allowed to write
# under ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX}.

_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS.install!= if [ ! -w /${DESTDIR}${PREFIX} ]; then echo install; else echo ''; fi

.if !empty(_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS.install)
_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS_TARGETS+= ${_SWITCH_CREDENTIALS.install}
