### DESCRIPTION

# This file manages variables carrying package information.


# Variables:
#
#  SRCDIR [${.CURDIR}, inherited]
#    The root of the source-tree of our package.
#
#
#  WRKDIR [${.OBJDIR}, inherited]
#    The root of the objdir-tree of our package.
#
#
#  PACKAGE [last component of SRCDIR, inherited]
#    The name of our package.
#
#    This name should be a valid Unix identifier, without spaces. If
#    it is not set, the last component of SRCDIR is used for this.
#
#
#  PACKAGEDIR [/${PACKAGE}, inherited]
#    A path element which can be used to build paths specific to our package.
#
#
#  VERSION [0.1.0-current, inherited]
#    The version of our package.
#
#
#  OFFICER [${EMAIL} or ${USER}@${HOST}, inherited]
#    The release engineering officer.
#
#    This identifies the GPG key used to sign tarballs and other
#    distributed files.
#
#
#  MODULE [not set]
#    The list of modules belonging to the package.
#
#    The list consists of pairs `module:path` where `module` is a BSD Owl
#    module like `ocaml.prog` or `latex.doc` or `c.lib` and path is the
#    path to the directory corresponding to the module with respect to
#    `${SRCDIR}`, the root of our source tree.
#
#
#  EXTERNAL [not set]
#    The list of external dependencies of the package.
#
#   The list consists of pair `consumer:resource` where `consumer` is a
#   keyword identifying the type of the external resource and `resource`
#   is its symbolic name.
