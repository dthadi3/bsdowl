### SYNOPSIS

# _MAKE_USERTARGET=	runconfigure depend build doc all install
# _MAKE_USERTARGET+=	clean distclean realclean update
# _MAKE_ALLSUBTARGET=	runconfigure depend build doc
#
# .include "bps.usertarget.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# Provide recipes and standard hooks for each of the targets
# enumerated by _MAKE_USER_TARGET.
#
# Define an all target, diverting the execution flow to the targets
# enumerated by _MAKE_ALLSUBTARGET.

# Variables:
#
#  _MAKE_USERTARGET [set by bps.init.mk]
#   The list of targets which are operated on
#
#   After reading this file, for any ${target} in _MAKE_USERTARGET
#   which does not exist yet:
#     1. If they exist {pre,do,post}-${target} are added to the dependencies
#        of ${target}
#     2. An empty definition of ${target} is provided.
#
#
#  _MAKE_ALLSUBTARGET
#   The list of targets subsumed by the target all
