### SYNOPSIS

# .include "bps.man.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# This library defines targets to build and install manual pages and
# hooks them to the build and installation processes.
#
# The list of manual pages to install must be conveyed by MAN. Other
# variables can be used to configure the process, as described
# hereafter.
#
# Manual pages are automatically installed in the adequate
# subdirectory based on their suffix.  However, the list of recognised
# suffixes is finite and held by the MANSECTIONS variable.


### VARIABLES

# DESTDIR [not set]
#  Change the tree where the manual pages get installed.
#
# MAN [not set]
#  Manual pages to be installed.
#
# MANDIR [${mandir}]
#  Base path for manual installation.
#
# MANOWN [${SHAREOWN}]
#  Manual owner.
#
# MANGRP [${SHAREGRP}]
#  Manual group.
#
# MANMODE [${SHAREMODE}]
#  Manual mode.
#
# MANSECTIONS [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 n l]
#  Manual sections.
#
# MANFILTER [not set]
#  Filter processing raw man pages before compressing or installing.
#
# DIRS [not set]
#  Directories that are searched for manual pages
#
# _MAN_AUTO [not set]
#  List of manual pages automatically added to MAN if they exist


### TARGETS

# buildman
#  Filter and compress manual pages.
#
# installman
#  Install manual pages.
#
# installmandirs
#  Install directories hosting manual pages.
